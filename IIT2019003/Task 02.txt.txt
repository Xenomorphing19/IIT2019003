	Competitive programming
-> I think I need not to explain why I want to learn CC. I have been told that, "CC ke bina naukri nahi milegi, aur naa hi chokri :P".
	FOSS
-> Open source is the future. FOSS is a great place to get familiar about that.
	Web Development
-> Something i want to explore. Aspirations too high XD.
